# Project to allow easy installation of new templates onto reMarkable 2 devices.

Currently this is a WiP and does nothing prticularly useful. Future commits will make this more usable.

Right now it will only establish a connection to a device and recover the templates.json file, parse it and list the templates which are installed.

Next steps include:
* Adding the ability to push a PNG/SVG pair with a new template description
* Generating the SVG directly from the PNG
* Ability to specify an icon file
* Maybe some sort of UI?
